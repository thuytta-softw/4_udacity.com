 - Include the <fstream> library 
 - Create a stream (input, output, both)
      - ofstream myfile; (for writing to a file)
      - ifstream myfile; (for reading a file)
      - fstream myfile; (for reading and writing a file)
 - Open the file  myfile.open(“filename”);
 - Write or read the file
 - Close the file myfile.close();
